中华人民共和国行政区划代码: Codes for the administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China
====================================================================================================

The GB/T 2260 standard defines six-digit numerical codes for the administrative divisions of China, at the county level and above. For instance, the Haidian district of Beijing has the code **110108**.

The most recent version of the official standard, designated "GB/T 2260-2007", was published in 2008. However, codes are routinely revised, and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) `publishes an updated list online annually <http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/tjbz/xzqhdm/>`_.

gb2260 exposes an up-to-date database of the GB/T 2260 codes, with extra information including English names, Pinyin transcriptions, administrative levels, etc., as well as code for updating the database with newly-released changes.
